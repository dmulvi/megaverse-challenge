# crossmint-megaverse-challenge

I used `react-node-template` as the base for this little challenge. 

This template combines a **client** generated by `create-react-app` and a **server** generated by `express-generator`.

In local dev, the React dev server & Node server are run side by side, with API calls [proxied](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/) through the React dev server to the Node server. 

## NOTES from Danny
See the Local Dev Setup section below if you actually want to run the app and see it in action.

The two main files that contain the code to complete the challenge are: 
- src/client/src/App.js
- src/server/routes/api.js

I planned to make some code improvements, but once I validated the second challenge the endpoints stopped working. 
The main things I planned to change:
- use local state instead of window object for variable storage
- split out the components into separate files
- combine the steps into a single action instead of requiring multiple button clicks
- move candidateId to .env file

### Project Structure

- `src/client` contains the [React](https://reactjs.org/) app
- `src/server` contains the [Node](https://nodejs.org/) [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) app
- `package.json` in the project root contains scripts to run in dev mode locally, and also to build and run on Heroku

### Local Dev Setup

All commands run from project root:

1. `cd src/client && npm install`
2. `cd src/server && npm install`
3. Make sure `nodemon` & `concurrently` are installed globally
4. `npm run dev`

You will now see the output of both the React dev server and the Node server in your shell, running at the same time thanks to `concurrently`. Enjoy!
